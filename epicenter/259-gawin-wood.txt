- Ethereum captured imagination more than Bitcoin
- the essence of Ethereum captured his imagination
- coded at hackathons in Miami and started thinking 
- saw that Ethereum as better Bitcoin, not so much about smart contracts 
- very about delivering the best technical solutions initially without focusing on marketing
- Developer focused 
- Polkadot founder 
- Substrate is against blockchain maximalism 
- going against hard forks 
- governance of blockchain must be process - on chain governance is execution of process automatically
- not there should be offchain process management
