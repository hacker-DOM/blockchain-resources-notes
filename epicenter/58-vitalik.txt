Epicenter Podcast Notes 3
- Vitalik - founder of Ethereum and writer at Bitcoin Magazine
- Ethereum - crypto 2.0 - many different projects trying to use blockchain for other things (ie. financial contracts on the blockchain) - Vitalik realized that best way to make a new programming language so that more features can be added 
- options - browser, plugin - in the end independent browser is the best 
- there will be an Ethereum library for IOS and Android 
- Ethereum browser - Mist 
- Berlin Defcon - interesting projects - Mist browser, virtual machine, proof of stake, Solidity programming language 
- programming language to control the money
- contracts - may be better name agents, actors 
- proof of stake - related to consensus systems - problem with Bitcoin - proof of work costs 600 million dollars per year (inefficient protocol) - consensus algorithm that is CPU friendly - Hashimoto - IO bound - every miner is forced to be a full node - the number of full nodes is declining 
- proof of stake - consensus algorithm - make it difficult to rewrite history - proof of work must compute mathematical problem - the amount of power you have is proportional to how many coins you have - variance problem for small miners (the answer is stake pools)
- Slasher algorithm - will not get a reward for another thousand blocks
