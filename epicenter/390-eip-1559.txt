- specializes in Algorithms 
- last year focusing more and more on blockchain research 
- focus on consensus protocols 
- started receiving calls about a specific set of expertise 
- interacted with non-traditional students 
-  need transactions to separate different types of transactions 
- how to determine gas price to pay - maybe set automatically (like metamask) - can make educated guess how much others are paying
- new mechanism improves tokenomics of protocol 
-  base fee (price floor) minimum gas price to get included in block
- base fee is independent of block
- base fee cannot go to minor of that block 
- where does base fee come from - local search 
- variable size blocks 
- base fee must be adjusted by the person
- why won't miners just publish empty blocks? - tips
- block size is being limited by average rate of creation 
- there is no new attack vector around collusion 
- Ethereum community is mobilized to minimize chaos (ie. around forks)
