- built privacy projects on hackatons 
- can put funds into Tornado Cash - can withdraw funds without knowing where the cash was put it (is this money laundering)
- 0 knowledge based not minus fee
- a bag where you put in coin and withdraw coins
- better to wait some time
- typical daily volume - dozens of transactions per each pool
- Ether is supported, DAI, CDAI
- assets for tornado cash pools 
- modifier hash
- way to improve would be make a way that is similar to ZCash
- layer 2 can be made cheaper
- anonymous founder - didn't want to be because lack of trust 
- compliance tool - prove link between deposit and withdrawal - can easily prove where funds came from 
- layer 2 is the direction of Tornado cash
