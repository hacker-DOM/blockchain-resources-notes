- summer of 2015 started 
- blockchain as a natural and elegant way to solve some problems
- first version but directly on top of Bitcoin
- Stacks 2.0 - can scale independently of Bitcoin 
- minor builds stacks block 
- bids and miners competing with each other 
- call to clarity conract
- fork of stacks chain 
- large number of miners
- sofisticated minors, big pools - handful of minors of a steady state - modeled after Bitcoin 
- microblocks - incentivised to include as many as possible 
- Bitcoin confirmations are finality numbers
- Stacks uses Bitcoin
- stacks blockchain can do more than Bitcoin - language clarity - Bitcoin had network effects - believe that everything will disappear apart from Bitcoin - that the security of the language is the most important
- clarity precise fee
- clarity not curing complete program 
- clarity can build most of things that solidity can do
- clarity probably has a steep learning curve
