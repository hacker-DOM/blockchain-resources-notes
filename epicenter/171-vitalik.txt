Epicenter Podcast Notes 2
- Vitalik Buterin 
- Ethereum governance is stabilizing more and more 
- smart programming safety is increasing 
- major crises in any ecosystem are inevitable
- proof of work to proof of stake - why? - advantages - reduces inefficient hardware costs, electricity costs (proof of excellence, proof of machine learning) - proof of stake is the most feasible; doesn't waste external hardware costs
- proof of stake is more secure against serious attackers 
- cost of attack is much lower than the cost of defence - cryptography is the opposite 
- there is a need to defend from a 51 per cent attack 
- how to incentivize participants with protocol - proof of stake 
- when will proof of stake be implemented? probably next year
- consensus by bet - can mimic proof of work - validators make consensus by bet - demphasizing the concept - traditional byzantine fault tolerance literature for consensus algorithm 
- Casper algorithm
- blockchain intropability
- notary schemes, hack logging
