- first EVM compatible zkRollup protocol 
- studied computer science in Berlin 
- started a number of startups 
- first startups was a copy of last pass 
- Ethereum was different than Bitcoin for him
- lived as consultant in Hong Kong
- zk roll-up - layer 1 scaling solution - 
- optimistic verification is different from zk roll-up
- zk rollups are cheaper as a scaling solution
- only use bandwidth not storage
- the bottleneck of Ethereum is storage and jumping around sequentially
- 100x improvement with zk roll-up
- Exodus mode 
- ZkSync - block time can vary 
- Zk porter - pay small fees independent of ethereum gas price
- zk rollups are mid to long term better than optimistic rollups, especially with frequent oracle updates
