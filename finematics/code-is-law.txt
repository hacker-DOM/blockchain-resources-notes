Finematics

- technology used to enforce rules
- codd can dictate what we do - with smart contracts this is possible
- smart contract code is stored and executed on the blockchain 
- if then semantics are used
- human factor from decision making is removed from smart contracts 
- works i. Fully deterministic way smart contract can rely purely on information available in the blockchain 
- oracle services can minimize trust 
- oracles are more likely to provide correct data
- solidity is used for writing smart contracts 
- all smart contracts are immutable
- decentralized are smart contracts
- traditional contracts are not cheaper
- reusability is possible with smart contracts
