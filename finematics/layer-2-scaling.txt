Finematics Notes 19
Ethereum Layer 2 Scaling 

- Scaling - debate begins often after network congestion
- network congestion in 2020 due to popularity of DEFI and yield farming
- very high gas fees 
- scaling blockchain can be layer 1 or layer 2 
- layer 2 is built upon layer 1 - increases number of transactions to 2-4 thousand per second
- Ethereum 2.0 - proof of stake and sharding - even with Ethereum 2.0 it is necessary for layer 2 scaling
- scalability should not come at cost of decentralization and security
- layer 2 scaling should increase tx speed and tx throughput
- Channels are an example of layer 2 scaling (payment and state channels)
- plasma is a layer 2 scaling solution (child chains from parent chains)
- sidechains - Ethereum compatible blockchains
- rollups - zk and optimistic - zk faster - optimistic even compatible
