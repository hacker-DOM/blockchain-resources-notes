Aztec Protocl
- zk roll-up
- zk money
- allows transaction to be cheaper than layer one transaction
- better than a private roll-up proof 
- can create zero launch proof 
- can link layer 1 address through DeFi bridge 
- uses same node sysem as rollups
- ZK money is the main source for front end protocols
- get transparency of layer 1 rollups
- more fixed protocols
- private transactions 
- must have abstract smart contracts 
- abstracting cryptography 
- this is a new way to write smart contracts 
- how important is to zero knowledge tech - it is very important, just like Ethereum
- zero knowledge proofs 
- creating abstraction layer with easy cryptography is foundational
