Finematics Notes 15 
Graph Protocol and GRT Token
- indexing protocol enabling for the creation of fully decentralized apps
- makes building decentralized apps easier
- December 2020 went live
- indexing - allows for reducing the time required for finding piece of information 
- database indexes cut search time 
- indexes speed up queries 
- indexing is important for blockchains 
- without indexing have naive approach for blocking starting with block one
- ingestion services - allow for faster retrieval of data
- decentralized query protocol for blockchain - the graph 
- uses graphql
- architecture of graph Protocol - indexers (bodě operátors of graph) (index subgraphs and earn rewards for this), consumers, curators (signal what subgraphs worth indexing) (receive rewards), delegators, fiahermen, arbitrators
- GRT token - used by curators to signal subgraphs which are worth indexing
