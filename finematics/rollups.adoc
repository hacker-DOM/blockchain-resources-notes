. Ethereum scaling
. When ethereum popular such as bull market 2021 gas fees become very high 
. Layer 1 scaling Layer 2 scaling sidechains
. Layer 1 - Eth2 - migration to proof of stake, sharding 
. Sharding and rollups can increase throughput of Ethereum network 
. Layer 2 solutions - channels - work well on a specific set of applications
. Rollups apply both
. Sidechains - less secure than Ethereum network 
. Rollups are most anticipated scaling solution - what are rollups?
. Rollups - computation of chain but data on chain (thereby still being able to use the security of the ethereum network)
. Rollups are excecuted outside of the chain 
. Data is taken, rolled up and excecutded on the main chain 
. How does ethereum know that the posted data was valid, not submitted by a bad actor?
. Different types of proofs 
. Optimistic rollups vs zk rollups 
. Eth2 and rollups transaction to spee
