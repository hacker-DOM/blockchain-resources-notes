Two Generals Problem Explained 
AKA TWO GENERALS paradox, or two armies problem
classic computer science thought experiment 
different than byzantine generals problem (more general problem)
TWO GENERALS PROBLEM
two armies two general planning attack on a common enemy
the city is valley, can easily fight off one army
must-do synchronized attack is the only chance to win
must send messenger across the territory 
if the messenger is caught then message is lost 
General A leader - send message attack tomorrow at dawn 
General B send confirmation
General A receives confirmation
This is not enough for confirmation General B does not know
But what if General A receives confirmation
That has to be confirmed
Infinite confirmations

Another thought experiment 
General A sends a message to not sure when the message reached
not able to tell if the message is received 
the inconsistent state is left 
cannot guarantee that consensus is reached 
There is no solution to the two generals problem
problem is unsolvable 

Similar to computer communication
Two computer systems 
untrusted communication channel
the inconsistent state between two machines 
TCP - transmission control protocol
4-way handshake 
FIN ACK FIN ACK
half-open connection 
TCP is a reliable protocol but does not solve two generals protocol
Number of people trying to solve two generals problem 
Accept the uncertainty of the communication channel, mitigate to a certain degree
General A - sends 100 messages and will receive at least one (serial number)
General B - can gauge how many messages were 
expensive
sends every 20 minutes
absence of messengers builds up confidence
speed vs cost tradeoff 

Summary > two generals problem, classic computer science problem that is unsolvable, communication over an unreliable channel
