- current fee model - first price auction (users bid for space in block)
- EIP 1559 - solves this problem - makes transaction fees more predictable, reduce delay, improve UX, create positive feedback loop 
- basefee - minimum fee to be laid in transaction - set fee per block
- miner tip introduced 
- feecap also introduced - must not be lower than base fee
- Current fee system less profit for miners 
- base fee burning
